# Inheritance

>Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class. 

## Benefits of inheritance are: 

- It represents real-world relationships well.
- It provides the reusability of a code. We donâ€™t have - to write the same code again and again. Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.
- It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.

*Python Inheritance Syntax*

```
Class BaseClass:
    {Body}
Class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
    {Body}
```
