# static polymorphism

# overloading

# Operator overloading
y = 8 * 2 # 16
z = "pop" * 2 # poppop
a = 5 + 6 # 11
b = "la" + "la" # lala

# method overloading 

koko= 0
light = "lkl"
pop(koko)
pop(light)
pop(koko,light)
pop()

# constructor overloading can be imagined as constructor itself a special type of method
