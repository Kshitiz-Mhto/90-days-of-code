#Pythonâ€™s memory allocation and deallocation method is automatic

# Python uses two strategies for memory allocation: 
#     Reference counting
#     Garbage collection

#enabaling and disabling the garbage collector

import gc
print(gc.isenabled())
gc.disable()
print(gc.isenabled())

# Destructure
# __del__(self)

# GC will call the destructure automatically just before destroying an object resource clean up activities will be performed by destructure!!
# when there is no any destructure then class object destructure will be called which will do nothing.

import time

# GC maynot destory object during program execution but will delete all the object after program execution. Until the reference count of the object is 0, GC will the delete that particular object

#when line 31 is executed the GC will come in action immediately for deleting t1 object
